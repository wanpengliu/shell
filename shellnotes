parameter to run script
-x debug the value
-v debug display the code being executed


bash script does not have execute permission, but can be run using 
bash [script]

without bash, it will check permission, then create subshell bash + [script]
when use bash command to run script, just kick off the script in the current shell instead of subshell

ALWAYS use double quotation when use variable "$variable"

variable="abc" -- No space b4 after then = sign

name="wa"
echo "${name}n"
Always put braces around variable
