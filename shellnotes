-v debug display the code being executed


bash script does not have execute permission, but can be run using 
bash [script]

without bash, it will check permission, then create subshell bash + [script]
when use bash command to run script, just kick off the script in the current shell instead of subshell

-----------------------------------variable ----------------------------
ALWAYS use double quotation when use variable "$variable"

variable="abc" -- No space b4 after then = sign

name="wa"
echo "${name}n"
Always put braces around variable 

export only share variable to child shell, but not parent shell

insert new line   -e is required
echo -e \n"

PS1 - when single quote, eval each time
      when double quote, eval first time

((a=2*3))

(( a= b + c )) //variable b and c didn't need $
